With this widget, you can enter a slug or id, select a template you created, and it will render the content according to your selected template.

== Description ==

With this WordPress widget, you can enter a slug or id, select a template part, and the widget will render the 
content, in a local loop, according to your selected template. Very handy for things like:

*	Pinning content (pages and posts) to the homepage. 
*	Rendering arbitrary content (pages and posts) in a sidebar or other widget area.
*	Define Wordpress widget areas, write subtemplates with your own HTML, render content any way you want.
*	Many more uses.

Very simple, but also very powerful and versatile. Also may be difficult to use for people who are not into template 
hacking, so if you're not used to php or html, this widget probably isn’t for you.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't know much about php or template hacking. Should I try this plugin? =

This is a plugin that's meant for advanced users, so probably not, unless you want to learn.

== Screenshots ==

1. This is what you'll see when you use the widget. Title is the same as other widgets, I usually leave it 
empty. Slug or id is the identifier of the page or post you want your template applied to. The slug is the last part 
of the url of the page or post. dcwss.jpg.
